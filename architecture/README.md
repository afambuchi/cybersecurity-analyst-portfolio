# Architecture Overview

This folder contains high-level architecture documentation for the portable SOC lab.  
It includes network topology diagrams, system roles, and the design principles that guide the environment.

The goal is to provide a clear understanding of how the system is structured, why certain choices were made, and how the components interact as the lab grows.

Current contents:
- Phase 1 network overview (WAN, LAN, Firewall, Analyst VM)

Future additions:
- Phase 2 VLAN segmentation
- Active Directory architecture
- SIEM and logging pipeline topology
- Endpoint visibility and management structure
