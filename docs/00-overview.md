# Project Overview

This SOC lab is a portable, self-contained environment designed for demonstrations, advanced practice, research, and instructional support.  
It runs on a compact mini-PC with Proxmox and supports realistic SOC workflows, endpoint analysis, and network segmentation.

The objectives of this environment are:
- To maintain a hands-on platform that supports the cybersecurity material I teach
- To provide a controlled setting for testing tools, techniques, and scenarios
- To refine concepts such as network segmentation, access control, endpoint monitoring, and log analysis
- To simulate real-world SOC conditions on hardware that is small, portable, and cost-effective

Phase 1 establishes the core: Proxmox, internal/external networking, an Ubuntu firewall, and a Linux analyst workstation.  
Later phases will expand into Windows infrastructure, SIEM deployment, endpoint management, and VLAN segmentation.
