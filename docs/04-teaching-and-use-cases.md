# Teaching and Use Cases

This lab is integrated into my instructional work and provides a practical foundation for demonstrating cybersecurity concepts.

## Teaching Use Cases
- Network segmentation and routing design
- Firewall rule creation and troubleshooting
- Endpoint logging and SIEM ingestion
- Incident response workflows
- Detection engineering with real systems
- Identity and access management demonstrations

## Research and Practice Use Cases
- Testing new tools and techniques
- Prototyping detection logic
- Evaluating endpoint visibility tools
- Running controlled offensive testing
- Exploring network behavior in isolated environments

The lab is intentionally designed to be portable and modular so it can support learning, testing, and scenario development over time.
