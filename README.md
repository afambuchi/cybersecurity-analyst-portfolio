Home SOC Lab Project
Building a full enterprise-grade security operations environment at home

Overview
This repository documents my journey building a complete SOC (Security Operations Center) lab using Proxmox, Tailscale, pfSense, Windows Server, Wazuh, and more.
The goal of this project is to develop hands-on cybersecurity, networking, and detection engineering skills.

Current Progress
✔ Installed Proxmox hypervisor
✔ Fixed network routing and DNS issues
✔ Added Proxmox to Tailscale for secure global remote access
✔ Deployed Ubuntu Analyst VM and connected to Tailscale

Next Steps
Build pfSense firewall
Set up Windows Server (Active Directory)
Join Windows 11 to the domain
Configure Wazuh SIEM
Develop Python automation for monitoring & IR
